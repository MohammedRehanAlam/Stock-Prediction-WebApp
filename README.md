Hello Everyone this is your Friend @MohammedRehanAlam,

This is just a Basic STOCK_PREDICTION_APP using PYTHON programming Language. There is few special libraries required to import. In this all the required PYTHON Language concepts have been revised.

In this I have used streamlit to construct all the components for the WebApp.
In this I have used yfinance to get the historic information of the stock.
In this I have used prophet for Automatic Forecasting Procedure.
In this I have used plotly for plot different graphs.
In this I have used pandas-datareader to read historic information if yfinance doesn't works.

Hope you all be motivated to try the code yourself without copying entirely 😎😁.


---> # all the required modules to be installed.
---> # pip install streamlit        or     pip install streamlit yfinance prophet plotly pandas-datareader
---> # pip install yfinance
---> # pip install prophet
---> # pip install plotly
---> # pip install pandas-datareader
---> # in the end use this code in the terminal "streamlit run stock_prediction_app.py"
